letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d sola.gg -d www.sola.gg

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - We were unable to install your certificate, however, we
   successfully restored your server to its prior configuration.
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.sola.gg/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.sola.gg/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2021-01-10. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
